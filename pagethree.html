        <div class="abtusp3">
            <p>At Mossy Earth we are proudly bootstrapped and fiercely independent. We never took on debt, external investments or philanthropy money and because of this we never rushed things. This means we’ve built our organisation slowly but steadily. And we think this is one of the reasons we have attracted an amazing team that is truly passionate about bringing back wild ecosystems.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are very proud of this wonderful group of people we have brought together. They are technical and methodical in their work and independent and reliable in their decision making. They put their all into this work and somehow still have energy to make us laugh and smile every day.
            <br>
