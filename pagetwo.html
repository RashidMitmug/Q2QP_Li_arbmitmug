        <h1 class="projtitle">Rewilding a Former Mining Site</h1>
        <p class="desc">Paul de Toirões is an important area for landscape connectivity in northwest Portugal where nature is recovering from years of mining. The 300-hectare property boasts one of the largest water surface areas in the Greater Côa Valley, consisting of lagoons, canals, and ponds. Its diverse range of environments are connected by seasonal flooding which supports a variety of wildlife and vegetation. In an area managed by our partners, Rewilding Portugal, this project presents an excellent opportunity to expand its habitats and establish a stronghold for wilderness in the region. Starting with our first intervention, we aim to enlarge and diversify the habitats through earthworks. We are partnering with Rewilding Portugal to enlarge and diversify the wetland habitats of Paul de Toirões by carrying out targeted earthworks to change the way water moves and accumulates in the landscape.</p>

        <h1 class="projtitle">The Mountain Birch Project</h1>
        <p class="desc">Montane woodland is a virtually extinct habitat in Scotland. Of the 5.1% of native forests in the Scottish Highlands, only a mere 4% exists above altitudes of 400 metres. Although important restoration schemes are working to restore Caledonian pine forest, temperate rainforests and montane willow scrub, a missing piece of the landscape is largely, if not completely neglected - mountain birch woodland. In what should be a transitional zone between lower and higher mountain woodlands, high-altitude adapted species like mountain birch have all but disappeared, leaving a gap in this ecological niche. This Mountain Birch Project (MBP), led by Reforesting Scotland, aims to progress efforts to reinstate mountain birch woodland in Scotland. It will involve locating remaining fragments, mapping their distribution and seed collection and propagation, as well as the establishment of a seed orchard. The overarching goal of this project is to reinstate mountain birch woodland in Scotland. Currently, there is a lack of access to high-altitude-adapted birches and because of this, we risk losing the last remaining fragments before they can be protected or studied. </p>

        <h1 class="projtitle1">Predolac Cave Cleanup</h1>
        <p class="desc1">For millions of years, water has run over the limestone and dolomite bedrocks of Croatia carving out a special subterranean world. In this mysterious underground terrain, uniquely adapted species have evolved in the dark, damp environments in what’s known as karst caves. Although we are no longer cave-dwelling species ourselves, our impact on these fragile ecosystems is still being felt. For decades, caves in Croatia have been used as dumping grounds for waste, which is threatening endemic cave species and polluting important sources of water. Supporting our partners BIOTA, we are attempting to undo some of the footprint by sending a team of technical divers into the Predolac cave to remove waste. The main objective of this project is to remove all of the waste in the Predolac cave and in doing so, improve the environment for populations of Congeria kusceri and Marifugia cavatica.</p>
